# spotify_library_manager
### A simple app that removes duplicate songs from a Spotify user's saved tracks
This is a node.js app that uses the express framework and pug view engine.  The motivation for this project was largely educational, improving my knowledge and competency surrounding:
1. APIs
2. HTTP requests
3. OAuth2.0
4. Javascript
5. Web development in general. 

Since the goal was to learn about back-end functionality, the user-interface is very bare-bones.  Before using this app, the user must first register an app with Spotify to obtain a client ID ad secret.  Upon providing the app with these credentials, the user can then view and delete the duplicate songs from their personal libraries
